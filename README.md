# DWM - Dynamic Window Manager

This is the patched, custom version of dwm that I've been using in my main machine for the last few months. All the patches under the `patches` directory have been applied and the colorscheme is hardcoded to use the base16-dracula pallete by default. No pywal integration for this one, didn't apply the `xresources` patch either. If you plan on use this, make sure you have the right fonts (including Font Awesome) installed before compiling.
